# ------------ PROJECT DEFINITION ------------------
# 1.	Identify the codon set most used in the Wuhan-1 strain
# 2.	Do a full count of all codons by AA
# 3.	Create a usage by AA table (all actual codons used by frequency for that AA)
#     a.	Look at the distribution of usage throughout the genome, e.g. by plotting the usage frequencies over the genome
#     b.	Look for the non-highest-frequency codons within the genome
#     c.	See if these are clustered in regions
# 4.	Compare to known non-human-pathogenic strain 
# ---------------------------------------------------



# get wuhan-1 strain genome sequence (from file or fetch from NCBI)

# get known non-human-pathogenic strain sequence 


# define codon:AA dictionary

# define wuhan-1 regions e.g. w1_orf_dic = {region:[start, stop]}


# define a fuction for codon count, codon_count()

# define a function for creating an codon usage table, codon_use_table()

# define a fuction for plotting usage frequencies over the genome, codon_freq_plot()




# count codons on wuhan-1

# create codon usage by AA table

# plot codon usage

# find non-highest-frequency codons

# comparison with other strains
